# Corne V4 Pro-Micro Edition

As the Corne V4 has a completely new board outline compared to the V3 and V2, all further development for the Corne will be using a new outline, this version brings back the Pro Micro footprint.
This PCB also adds wireless support with the inclusion of battery pads and a battery switch, as well as a removable 6th column, as well as **MX and Choc** switch support. 
Unfortunately for this to be possible the additional encoder/switch pads in the Corne V4 needed to be removed to make room for this footprint.
This gives the option to make your Corne wireless with a Nice!Nano V2, swap out microcontrollers if you're upgrading, and ultimately save costs.

# Corne V4 Pro-Micro Edition

This version of the Corne V4 is beginner friendly, and brings back the option to make your Corne with whatever microcontroller you want, which allows wireless support with a Nice!Nano V2, and ultimately save costs when ordering as you DO NOT need PCBA.

The Corne V4 has a completely new board outline compared to the V3 and V2, and all further development for the Corne will be using the V4 outline. This version brings back the Pro Micro footprint so all future cases and development is compatible with a Pro-Micro version PCB.

- Pro Micro Footprint Daughter Board Support
- MX Spaced
- Hotswap MX and Choc Support
- Breakaway 6th column for 5 column builds
- Wired and Wireless Support with the inclusion of battery pads and battery switch
- OLED support

Original Board designed by Foostan, modified By Kea Workshop.

## Firmware 

No external firmware is needed, the same firmware found on the VIAL and QMK repos for the Corne V2 will work for this PCB.
